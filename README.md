# Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis for E-Commerce

## Overview

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior on an e-commerce platform to uncover meaningful trends and patterns. The goal is to use these insights to improve marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and enhance the overall customer experience.

## Objectives

- Understand customer buying patterns and preferences.
- Identify high-value customers who contribute the most revenue.
- Measure the impact of marketing campaigns on sales.
- Provide actionable recommendations to boost sales and increase customer loyalty.
- Help stabilize fluctuating sales and improve customer retention.

## Problem Statement

The e-commerce platform faces two major challenges:

1. **Fluctuating sales:** Inconsistent sales volumes lead to unstable revenue streams.  
2. **Low customer retention:** A significant number of customers do not return for repeat purchases, limiting growth potential.

Without clear data-driven insights into customer behavior, it becomes difficult for the business to implement effective marketing, inventory, and customer engagement strategies.

## What I Did

- Designed a relational database schema to capture customers, products, orders, and order items.  
- Populated the database with sample customer data, product catalog, orders, and order details.  
- Analyzed purchase data using SQL queries to extract:  
  - Number of orders per customer  
  - Monthly sales trends and seasonality  
  - Customer spending totals and segmentation into low, medium, and high spenders  
  - Identification of top customers based on total spending  
  - Distribution of orders by value ranges (low, medium, high)  

---

## Insights & Findings

- Customers vary widely in their purchasing frequency and total spend, enabling segmentation into distinct groups.  
- Monthly sales fluctuate, indicating seasonal trends that can be leveraged for campaign planning and inventory stocking.  
- A small percentage of high-value customers contribute disproportionately to total revenue.  
- Most orders fall into the low to medium value ranges, suggesting opportunities to upsell or increase average order value.  
- Certain product categories (e.g., Electronics) dominate sales, while others may require marketing focus to boost interest.

## Actions & Recommendations

- **Focus marketing efforts** on high-value and frequent customers to improve retention and loyalty.  
- **Develop personalized promotions** based on customer segments to increase engagement.  
- **Optimize inventory** based on seasonal sales trends to reduce overstock and stockouts.  
- **Introduce upselling and cross-selling strategies** targeting customers with low to medium order values.  
- **Track and measure marketing campaign effectiveness** by linking customer behavior and sales data.
